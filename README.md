This is the start of a project that helps me automate my meal planning and grocery shopping.
As it currently works, you can input 1 or 2 ingredients and and the result is a list of possible recipes I can make.
In the future, I plan to be able to search with more than two ingredients to refine my recipe options. I'd also like this as a tool to help plan grocery trips and minimize waste by calculating how much of each ingredient I'll need for the recipes I plan to make.
